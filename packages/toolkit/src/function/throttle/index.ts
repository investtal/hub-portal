/**
 * A class that creates a throttled function.
 *
 * Throttling ensures a function is called at most once within a specified time window.
 * Unlike debouncing which waits for a pause in calls, throttling guarantees consistent
 * execution timing regardless of call frequency.
 *
 * Supports both leading and trailing edge execution:
 * - Leading: Execute immediately on first call (default: true)
 * - Trailing: Execute after wait period if called during throttle (default: true)
 *
 * For rate limiting or hard API limits, consider using RateLimiter instead.
 * For collapsing rapid-fire events, consider using Debouncer.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const throttler = new Throttler(
 *   (id: string) => api.getData(id),
 *   { wait: 1000 } // Execute at most once per second
 * );
 *
 * // First call executes immediately
 * throttler.maybeExecute('123');
 *
 * // Subsequent calls within 1000ms are throttled
 * throttler.maybeExecute('123'); // Throttled
 * ```
